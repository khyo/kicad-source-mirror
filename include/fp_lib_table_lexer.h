 * otherwise the C++ compiler will eventually complain if it sees more than one
 * DSNLEXER in the same compilation unit, say by mutliple header file inclusion.
 * Plus this also enables re-use of the same enum name T.  A typedef can always be used
 * to clarify which enum T is in play should that ever be a problem.  This is
 * unlikely since Parse() functions will usually only be exposed to one header
 * file like this one.  But if there is a problem, then use:
 *   typedef FP_LIB_TABLE_T::T T;
